##Faulconbridge Bike Trail, NSW
After a little bit of thought and head scratching, about where would be a good fire trail, I recently decided to attempt the Faulconbridge Bike Trail. Based on the car guidance from <a href=\"https://www.bluemts.com.au/info/thingstodo/mountain-bike-trails/faulconbridge-point-lookout/\">here</a> we successfully navigated west of Sydney to Jennings Road, with many other long weekend holiday makers, towards the Blue Mountains. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/06/IMG_5464.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Lookout Point, well worth a 45 minute ride</figcaption></figure><p>Around 6.6 km according to my strava log, at 45 minutes it was a slow but enjoyable ride, with a mix of sand and rocks to cycle along. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-container\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/06/IMG_5430-1.jpg\" width=\"3024\" height=\"4032\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/06/IMG_5488.jpg\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/06/IMG_5479.jpg\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></div></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-row\"><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/06/IMG_5452.jpg\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\"></div><div class=\"kg-gallery-image\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-10.49.38-pm.png\" width=\"1582\" height=\"698\"></div></div></div></figure>
