##Faulconbridge Bike Trail, NSW

After a little bit of thought and head scratching, about where would be a good fire trail, I recently decided to attempt the Faulconbridge Bike Trail. Based on the car guidance from [here](https://www.bluemts.com.au/info/thingstodo/mountain-bike-trails/faulconbridge-point-lookout/) we successfully navigated west of Sydney to Jennings Road, with many other long weekend holiday makers, towards the Blue Mountains.

Lookout Point, well worth a 45 minute ride

Around 6.6 km according to my strava log, at 45 minutes it was a slow but enjoyable ride, with a mix of sand and rocks to cycle along.
